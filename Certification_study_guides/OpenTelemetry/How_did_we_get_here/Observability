### General approach
Developers tend to focus on workload troubleshooting
Operations tend to focus on resource based troubleshooting

Software abstractions make up the distributed systems (including mircroservices)

## 3 Golden Signals
### Logs
Append only data structure
Timestamped with a brief message of what took place
Unstandardized for the most part (can include any information)
To combat log noise, key-value pairing was incorporated as well as structured logging
Logging agents were soon built to store logs and ability to search through them

### Metrics
4 main type of metrics
Counter (up/down)
Gauge (up/down)
Histogram(only positive)
Summary 

### Traces
Allows to follow chain of events of a system
Can tell a story and provide a "larger" context for what is taking place


### Issues with different telemetry approaches
#### siloed Telemetry
* lacks quality of telemetry data
* Manual effort to create relationships between individual non-correllated data
* Need to manually write queries based of a hypothesis for what needs to be found

#### Lack of standards leads to low quality
* root-cause analysis are difficult when telemetry data lacks consistency
* Difficult to correlate events across services
* Fragmented and disjointed views of system behavior

#### No built in instrumentation is open sourced
* Difficult to integrate into systems
* vendor specific
* Most solutions are layered built on top of other software
* New version of software increases overhead
* Leads to vendor lock in

### What is Open Telemetry?
* Unified
* vendor neutral 
* Cross-platform

### What Open Telemetry is NOT
* Not an all in one solution
* Does not replace full-fledged monitoring platforms
* Not a data storage or Dashboard solution
* Open Telemetry focuses on collection and exporting of telemetry, not storing it
* Requires configuration in order to work with other tools, does not provide out-of-the-box monitoring and alerting
* does not automatically optimize application performance

### Benefits of Open Telemetry
* Configure once and use everywhere
* Open telemetry is meant to be long lasting and stable states should not become compromised regardless of time/usage
* Open Telemetry separrates telemetry data creation from analysis. Multi-vendor support incentivices competition
* Developers can instrument projects from the beginning without needing a vendor specific solution immediately 
* Open Telemetry improves how we use telemetry and attempts to correlate different signals instead of keeping them separated
