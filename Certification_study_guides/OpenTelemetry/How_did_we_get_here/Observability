### General approach
Developers tend to focus on workload troubleshooting
Operations tend to focus on resource based troubleshooting

Software abstractions make up the distributed systems (including mircroservices)

## 3 Golden Signals
### Logs
Append only data structure
Timestamped with a brief message of what took place
Unstandardized for the most part (can include any information)
To combat log noise, key-value pairing was incorporated as well as structured logging
Logging agents were soon built to store logs and ability to search through them

### Metrics
4 main type of metrics
Counter (up/down)
Gauge (up/down)
Histogram(only positive)
Summary 

### Traces
Allows to follow chain of events of a system
Can tell a story and provide a "larger" context for what is taking place
